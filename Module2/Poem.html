        <h1>Conscience</h1>
        Whatever you do people will talk about you<br>
        When you are rich they will talk<br>
        When you are poor, you will always be their head topic<br>
        When you do Good, you are in trouble<br>
        When you do bad, They will Enter itt in their record<br>
        Why can't you do what <em><strong>Conscience</strong></em> you and leave the rest to God for Judgment<br>

        <h1>what are you?</h1>
        You are not a product of a broke home,<br> 
        a poverty ridden neighborhood,<br> 
        a family of drunkard, <strong>or a world in the upheaval of war</strong><br>
        <br>
        you are the product of you own thinking process<br>
        and what ever you are thinking is the stone corner of <em>your tomorrow</em> <br>
        Truly what a man think i what determine or rather indicate his faith<br>
        If there's no one to hold your hand, put your hand in your pocket and continue your way<br>
